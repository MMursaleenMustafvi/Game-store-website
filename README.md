üéÆ Game Store Website

Project Overview
This Game Store Website is a robust, full-stack e-commerce simulation developed as a 4th-semester group project by M. Mursaleen Mustafvi and Taha Saleem. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate a complete and interactive web application workflow, from responsive front-end design to secure back-end data management. It showcases a modern architecture using Node.js (Express) for server-side logic and SQL for persistent database storage.

This application is built to be responsive across various devices, providing a smooth user experience that mirrors real-world e-commerce platforms.
